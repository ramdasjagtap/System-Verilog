#) Systemverilog-
The most valuable benefit of SystemVerilog is that it allows the user to construct reliable, repeatable verification environments, in a consistent syntax, that can be used across multiple projects.

Verification Guidelines-
 - Bugs are Good.
 - Block level
 - Integration level
 

 ##) Procedural Blocks-
 1) always_comb-
    - represent combinational logic.
    - infers its sensitivity list.
    - avoid the mismatch ( always @(*) )
    - shared variables are prohabited.
    - easy for software to identify the logic.
    - always @(x,y,z) v/s always_comb -> execute ones even if no change in sensitivity list.
    - always @(*) -> shared variables.
    - 
 2) always_latch
 3) always_ff
